    <h2>How does this work?</h2>

    <p>We have a 16 bit grayscale DEM height map:</p>

    <figure>
      <img
        style="max-height: 40vh"
        src="https://cdn.glitch.global/6f093c76-7f96-4f52-94dd-2b1647bfb115/ALPSMLC30_N048W124_DSM.900m.png?v=1687792965948"
      />
    </figure>

    <p>
      ...uhh, okay yeah that's super exciting, let's level that a little so you
      can actually see what it looks like:
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img
        style="max-height: 40vh"
        src="https://cdn.glitch.global/6f093c76-7f96-4f52-94dd-2b1647bfb115/ALPSMLC30_N048W124_DSM.900m.png?v=1687807910178"
      />
    </figure>

    <p>
      Every pixel in this image isn't a "color" so much as a height value,
      where white pixels are "pretty high up!" and black pixels are effectively
      sea level (or, technically maybe even a little lower than that!)
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to turn this (frankly) not very useful information into a good
      looking 2D map, we can convert the height map into something that (to a
      computer at least) looks like a 3D surface, so thast we can then shine
      some light on it and get something that looks... you know... like actual
      terrain.
    </p>

    <p></p>

    <p>
      The standard way to do this is to compute the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_(geometry)"
        >surface normal</a
      >
      for each pixel, i.e. the vector that tells us the 3D angle of the surface
      at that pixel, by looking at each pixel's four direct neighbours. This is
      surprisingly simple: we just create a vector
      <code>{x: a-b, y: c-d, z: 2}</code> where "a" and "b" are the heights for
      the pixels at (x-1,y) and (x+1,y) respectively, and "c" and "d" are the
      heights for the pixels at (x,y-1) and (x,y+1), respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we then normalize that vector (i.e. scale it such that it has a total
      length of 1) and render it as an RGB vector (so, pretending that "x"
      represents the pixel's red value, "y" the green value, and "z" the blue
      value) we get this:
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img
        src="https://cdn.glitch.global/6f093c76-7f96-4f52-94dd-2b1647bfb115/ca49a69d-9691-4aa3-82fa-2f9d7cc13977.image.png?v=1687808057302"
      />
    </figure>

    <p>
      We can then compute how much light would get reflected "up" into the
      screen, given the sun at some specific position: we can use the standard
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(mathematics)"
        >vector reflection</a
      >
      approach to have a "ray of sunlight" bounce off of our pixel's surface,
      giving us a neatly illuminated terrain view:
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img
        src="https://cdn.glitch.global/6f093c76-7f96-4f52-94dd-2b1647bfb115/4ebb214e-ce20-4ced-a695-d5c55d79e79b.image.png?v=1687808402386"
      />
    </figure>

    <p>
      So that covers the general shading, but there's not a lot of color here
      yet. Which makes for a pretty bad map.
    </p>

    <p>
      We want a <em>nice</em> map, so let's make a coloring book: we can take
      our height map and, using the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_squares"
        >Marching Squares</a
      >
      algorithm, find all regions that have the same general elevation so that
      we get lines that separate different altitudes. For example, if we picked
      a 100 foot spacing, we can get one line that separates "everything between
      100 feet and 200 feet", another for "everything between 200 feet and 300
      feet", and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can run this with as many "bands" as we like, to get something that
      looks like this:
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img
        src="https://cdn.glitch.global/6f093c76-7f96-4f52-94dd-2b1647bfb115/1ae33f7f-1734-4858-8389-c431a1371c9e.image.png?v=1688153884945"
      />
    </figure>

    <p>
      And we can can then fill in the areas between these
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contour_line">"isolines"</a> using
      some false color designed to look appropriate to the elevation we're
      coloring in:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>light green for low altitudes,</li>
      <li>darker green for slightly higher altitudes,</li>
      <li>brown for high altitudes with less/no vegetation, and</li>
      <li>blue/white for really high altitudes, to fake some snow.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Which gives us something that looks like this:</p>

    <figure>
      <img
        src="https://cdn.glitch.global/6f093c76-7f96-4f52-94dd-2b1647bfb115/6a6ce669-97d4-46ed-9e44-4be3dea6899f.image.png?v=1688153947136"
      />
    </figure>

    <p>
      And to be honest, this already kinda looks like a pretty nice 2D map. But,
      we can do even better by mixing in our terrain shading...
    </p>

    <p>
      If we make the iso lines themslves less pronounced (say, 80% transparent)
      and we overlay our "shaded" black and white image using the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_modes#Dodge_and_burn"
        >color-burn</a
      >
      method, (after blurring it a little) to generate the general, subtle
      shading, we get this:
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img
        src="https://cdn.glitch.global/6f093c76-7f96-4f52-94dd-2b1647bfb115/5f62ae82-a8e5-442d-8b17-cd8c5ef1baf0.image.png?v=1688154522358"
      />
    </figure>

    <p>That might look a little fuzzy, but we're not quite done yet.</p>

    <p>
      If we add the shaded height map as a 70% transparent overlay to the
      previous view (without blurring this time), we end up highlighting and
      "crisping up" all the landscape features, and end up with a kick-ass
      looking 2D map!
    </p>

    <p>
      Although we do need to make sure that we don't shade anything that's
      perfectly flat, so we do a quick calculation of what value corresponds
      with "the sun, reflected on a perfectly flat surface" and then we filter
      out anything with that exact value, to get:
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img
        src="https://cdn.glitch.global/6f093c76-7f96-4f52-94dd-2b1647bfb115/6c53bf48-e957-49fb-942f-6018c14d3ce1.image.png?v=1688155820711"
      />
    </figure>

    <p>
      And done! That's how you turn a height map image into a pretty sweet 2D
      map!
    </p>

    <p>
      ... but as a final touch, of course, we can bring it back to the animated
      graphics all the way at the top: we can tie the sun's vector to the
      position of the cursor on the image, so that we can change the way the
      terrain gets lit simply by moving the cursor around!
